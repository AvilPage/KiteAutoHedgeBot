# KiteAutoHedgeBot

Simple GUI tool to automatically calculate & place hedge orders for open positions. No API keys needed.

### How it works

It internally uses Kite Web apis using a third party library called jugaad_trader & kiteconnect. It uses the same credentials as you use for logging into Kite Web. It does not store any of your credentials. It is a simple tool to calculate the hedge orders for your open positions. It does not place any orders on its own. It just shows you the hedge orders that you can place on your own.
